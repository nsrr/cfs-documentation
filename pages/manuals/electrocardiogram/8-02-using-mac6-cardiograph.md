## 8.2 Using the MAC6 Cardiograph

Keyboard Description: The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is on the top part of the Mac®6 keyboard and is used for entering information and displaying messages. The keyboard descriptions listed below correspond to the MAC®6 keyboard.

* **Patient Information:** Press either 1 or 2 key to enter patient information (patient name, age, sex, etc.)
* **Rhythm Leads:** Press either 3 or 4 key to change the rhythm leads
* **Writer Speed:** Press either 5 or 6 key to change the writer speed – either 5, 10, 25, or 50 mm/s. (however, only MAC 6 cardiographs manufactured after July 1989 or later can print at 50 mm/s)
* **Writer Gain:** Press either 7 or 8 key to change the writer gain – either 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mm/mV. (Adjusting the gain only affects the <u>output</u> traces. Data for the 12SL analysis program are always measured at the 10 mm/mV setting)
* **More:** Press either 9 or 0 key to return to the first display of the Main Menu.
* **Bad Lead Messages:** Press either the 5 or 6 key to enable or disable the Bad Lead feature. Selecting FlatLine will result in a flat line report if an override of a “Bad Limb Lead” error message occurred during data acquisition. Selecting Use will print a report if raw data and no lead error messages will be displayed during data acquisition. (The ability to print a report of raw data without havng to override any lead error messages is only possible when using an AM-3 with a product code of “LE”).
* **Pacemaker Gain:** Press either 3 or 4 key to enable of disable the PaceGain feature. Selecting Enhance will enable PaceGain. Selecting Normal will disable PaceGain. (When PaceAGain is enabled, the pacemaker spike on ECG reports is enhanced, thus making it more obvious. PaceGain will only function when using an AM-3 with a product code of “LE”).
* **Writer Filter:** Press either the 1 or 2 key to change the writer filter – ether 40Hz or 100 Hz. (The filter selection only affects the <u>output</u> traces. The 12SL analysis program always analyzes the data at 100Hz).
