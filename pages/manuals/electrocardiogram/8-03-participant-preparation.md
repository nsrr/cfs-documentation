## 8.3 Participant Preparation

* The participant, stripped to the waist, is asked to sit or lie in a supine position on the recording bed with shoulders straight and arms relaxed at the sides. Some participants are too infirm to lie flat.
* The ECGs will be taken in a supine or semi-recumbent position (some participants may be too infirm to be comfortable in a supine position). The participant’s safety is imperative.
* The location for ECG recording must be stable and properly supported (ex. bed). A reclining chair (eg, Lazy Boy) can be used for the ECG, if necessary.
* To assure compatibility of data, follow the uniform procedures for electrode placement, skin preparation and quality assurance below.
* Explain why we are doing this, especially if the patient seems curious. _“We are trying to improve our understanding of the relationship between breathing during sleep and heart disease.”_
* If participant is female, have her remove her arms from her clothing, but keep a piece of clothing or a sheet draped over her chest.
* Thoroughly rub each electrode site with alcohol. This removes oil from the skin.
* Ask the participant to avoid movements that may cause errors in marking the electrode locations, but encourage the participant to talk.
* Check the following:

 * Bed <u>must</u> be wide enough to support the elbows
 * Participant is comfortable and relaxed
