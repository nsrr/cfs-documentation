## 4.3 Urine Collection

### 4.3.1 Preparation

It is suggested that female participants may prefer to use a Nun’s hat for urine collection.  If so, follow the instructions provided with this collection kit. Male participants, and female participants if they would prefer to, may urinate directly into a specimen collection container.

Specimen containers for routine random urine collection should be chemically clean, and have a tight fitting lid to prevent leakage during transportation.  (Suggestion for standard sterile specimen container:  Lab Safety Cat# OR-29091).  The 1–2 L urine containers used to pool the overnight collection must be clearly labeled with Participant ID number.

Participants should empty their bladders prior to the 10:30 PM blood draw.   This urine will be discarded.   All urine voided between 11:00 PM and 8:00 AM will be collected.   The participant will ring the GCRC staff to collect the urine samples.

Rarely, a patient will refuse to provide a urine sample.  Please keep a list of the ID numbers   of any of these participants and identify which test they refused.
