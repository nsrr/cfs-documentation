## 4.4.2.1 Blind Duplicates

<u>Aliquot Scheme</u>:

| Urine Container # | Sample     | Vial Size (mL) | Color  | Cryovial# | Sample Vol. (mL) |
|:-----------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| 1                 | Urine      | 4.0            | Clear  | 1         | 3.0              |
| 1                 | Urine      | 10.0           | Yellow | 2         | 9.0              |
| 2                 | Urine+Acid | 10.0           | Green  | 3         | 9.0              |

Blind duplicates will also be processed for urine.  At least 35 participants will be selected for urine blind duplicates.  Each time an EDTA tube is drawn for a blood blind duplicate, urine blind duplicates will be processed as well.  The urine QC ID numbers are the same as the blood QC ID numbers except that the final digit is a 5.  The 2 digit extension denotes the cryovial number: 99930005-01.  The QC number is matched to the Participant ID at Case Western Reserve University.

The urine blind duplicates will be aliquoted after the regular urine samples are added to tubes #36–40.   They are color-coded in the same way as the regular urine samples.

It is important to complete the Blind Duplicate Shipping Log and include a copy in the shipping box with the frozen samples.  Ship frozen urine blind duplicates at least one month after the original participant’s samples are shipped to LCBR.  Blind duplicate samples may be shipped individually or several samples may be stored and shipped at the same time.
