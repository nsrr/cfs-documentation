## 12.13.2 Scoring Procedure

* 1. Run the <u>oral_scoring.bat</u> batch file.
* 2. Select the appropriate option based on which data you wish to process (1. Family Rhinometry)
* 3. The program will remove all files currently in the Oral File Directory folder and will copy files from the appropriate study directory to Oral File folder.
* 4. In the ORAL 5.03 scoring program, hit **F6** to view patient list.  If RhinoCheck.sas was not run or did not run successfully, the userfile will not be valid and there will be no studies to view.
* 5. Select the participant file of interest.  There will be two files identically named.  This is because of the pre- and post- nasal steroid tests. Do one at a time.
* 6. Press **Enter**.
* 7. Enter analysis segments as 0.00 to 6.00 and assign curve scores according to the following:

 * If at least one of the two graphs goes off the chart in the analysis segment, score as 2.
 * If not scored as 2, then if the two graphs have wide variation (not replicated) in the analysis segment, score as 3.
 * If not scored as 2 or 3, then if at least one of the two graphs goes off the chart after the analysis segment, score as 4.
 * If not scored as 2, 3 or 4, then if identified by the SAS program as an outlier, score as 5.
 * If not scored as 2, 3, 4 or 5 and the graphs look good, score as 1.

* 8. Only if necessary: press **F5** to adjust segment length.  These are the last two categories at the end of the page. Type in appropriate length.
* 9. Print Rhinometry curves.
* 10. Press **F6** to view the other file.
* 11. Press **Enter**.
* 12. Repeat Steps 7 – 9
* 13. Press **Esc** to exit ORAL 5.03.
