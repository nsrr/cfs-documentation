## 12.6 Acquiring Data

1. Using the left/right arrow keys, highlight **Acquire** on the screen.
2. Select the appropriate 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th trial windows with the up/down keys.
3. Prepare the rhinometer by securing the rubber nosepiece to the end of the rhinometer tube.
4. Place the rhinometer under the nares of the subject. The nosepiece should be touching the base of the nares close enough to ensure a good seal, but <u>not</u> pushing into the nares, which will distort the shape of the nasal, distorting results.
5. Inform the subject to stop breathing and to hold very still for a few seconds while you run the test. **<u>NOTE</u>:** Additional instructions may be required for some participants to understand the difference between ‘stopped breathing’ and taking a large breath and holding it, which will distort results.
6. With the nosepiece in place under the nares, and the subject not breathing, press either **Enter** or the **Start/Stop** button on the rhinometer.  When a series of clicks is heard, the rhinometer has taken a measurement of the nasal cavity.
7. Hit the **Start/Stop** button any time after hearing a beep to stop the trial.  The beep indicates that there has been the minimum number of trials taken to produce a graph.  When the beep is heard, there is also a large dot appearing in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
8. Test the same nares again.
9. Repeat this procedure for the other nares, so that you have two trials for each side of the nose.
10. When 2 reproducible trials have been taken for each nares, save the file.

### 12.6.1 Administering Decongestant to the Participant

**<u>Effective 8/16/2002</u>:** The GCRC nursing staff was charged with the administration of the Neosynepherine to the participants.

A new dropper will be used with each participant.

1. Fill a dropper with approximately 1/3 of Neosynephrine.
2. Have a tissue in one hand and the dropper in the other.
3. Have the participant tilt their head back as far as they can.
4. Do not insert the dropper into the nares.  Instead, hold dropper above nostril.
5. Instruct participant to inhale deeply as you drop 1 drop into the nostril. If participant has difficulty inhaling the decongestant, nurse will press the opposite nostril closed as the participant inhales.
6. Repeat for a total of 2 drops per nostril.
7. The neosynephrine should be allowed to take effect for approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
8. Repeat the above ‘Acquiring Data’ procedure to obtain another pair of trials for each nares.
9. Save file.
