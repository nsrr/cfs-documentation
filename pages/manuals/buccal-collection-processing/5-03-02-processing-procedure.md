3. After ten minutes, remove the holder from the water bath.
4. Mix or shake the tubes briefly.
5. Remove brush using a pair of tweezers and discard.  To avoid contamination between samples, wipe the tip of the tweezers with a gauze square before placing the tweezers into another microcentrifuge tube.  Samples may be stored at this stage at room temperature for at least 7 days.
