## 2.10 Procedures if Participant is Found to Have Excessively High Blood Pressure

**Please notify Dr. Redline if blood pressure is:**

**Adults: 220/110 or greater**

**Children: 180/110 or greater**


Ask the participant if he/she is on high blood pressure medicine and if he/she has taken it today. _How often do they take their blood pressure medicine?_  Observe the participant’s condition: are they sweating, clammy, nervous, or shaking?  Call Dr. Redline to report blood pressure readings, x44997 pager # 31168.  Have participant lie quietly and re-take the blood pressure in 15 minutes. If a home visit, if appropriate, advise him/her to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Again, if necessary, call 911 EMS after speaking to Dr. Redline unless you feel it is an immediate emergency. If this is a GCRC visit, call the Medical Resident on call or a call a “triple page”.
