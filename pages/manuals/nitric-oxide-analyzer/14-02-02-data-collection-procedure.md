## 14.2.2 Data Collection Procedure

1. Connect the two male Luer fittings from the nitric oxide analyzer to the two female Luer ports on the Breath Value.
2. Position the patient so that they can view the computer monitor.
3. Observe the ambient NO level. The ambient NO level is indicated by the fluctuating numbers in the NOA menu window.  Record on patient physio report.
4. Select the **Acquire** button to display the Acquire Window
5. A file save dialog window will be displayed. Enter a file name where the data is to be saved: last name and first two letters of first name. (Ex. Patient: John Smith – SmithJO)
6. After entering the file name, select **Save** or **OK** button. Data from the NOA will begin plotting on the chart.
7. Instruct the patient to inhale to TLC and then begin exhaling while watching the bar graph (patient should use nose clips).
8. Have patient adjust the force of exhalation to reach the arrow on the bar
9. The color of the bar will change from red to green if the pressure is within 16% of the desired pressure.
10. The bar must remain in the green zone for at least 6 seconds for adults, 3 seconds for children.
11. Data collection will automatically stop when the plot reached the end of the run time.
12. If the calculated plateau is acceptable, press the **Level OK, Add to Results** button.
13. If exhalation does not meet the ATS criteria, a warning message will be displayed indication the nature of the problem and the Reject button will be flashing. Selecting the Reject will return to the main REB window without returning the NO plateau.
14. Allow the patient to rest for at least 30 seconds between measurements
15. Repeat steps 9 through 18 until 3 NO plateaus, which agree within 5% of the mean value, are obtained.
16. Select the **Save Results** button from the Main REB window to save patient information, NO plateaus, and statistics.
17. A file save dialog window will be displayed. Enter a file name where the data is to be saved: last name and first two letters of first name. (Ex. Patient: John Smith – SmithJO)
