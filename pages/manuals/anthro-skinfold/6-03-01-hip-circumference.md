## 6.3 Anthropometry Measurement

### 6.3.1 Hip Circumference

* The subject should wear only nonrestrictive briefs or underwear, or a light smock over underwear.
* The subject stands erect with arms at the sides and feet together. The measurer squats at the side of the subject so that the level of maximum extension of the buttocks can be seen.
* An inelastic tape is placed around the buttocks in a horizontal plane at this level without compressing the skin.
* An assistant is needed to help position the tape on the opposite side of the subject’s body.
* The zero end of the tape should be below the measurement value.
* The tape is in contact with the skin but does not indent the soft tissue.
* The measurement is done to the nearest 0.1 cm.
