## 6.3 Anthropometry Measurement

### 6.3.1 Hip Circumference

* The subject should wear only nonrestrictive briefs or underwear, or a light smock over underwear.
* The subject stands erect with arms at the sides and feet together. The measurer squats at the side of the subject so that the level of maximum extension of the buttocks can be seen.
* An inelastic tape is placed around the buttocks in a horizontal plane at this level without compressing the skin.
* An assistant is needed to help position the tape on the opposite side of the subject’s body.
* The zero end of the tape should be below the measurement value.
* The tape is in contact with the skin but does not indent the soft tissue.
* The measurement is done to the nearest 0.1 cm.

### 6.3.2 Waist Circumference

* The subject should wear little clothing so that the tape may be correctly positioned. The measurement should not be made over clothing. If clothing must be worn, subjects should undress to light underwear and wear only a cloth or paper smock during the measurement.
* The subject stands erect with the abdomen relaxed, the arms at the sides and feet together. The measurer faces the subject and places an inelastic tape around the subject, at the level of the natural waist, which is the narrowest part of the torso.
* An assistant is needed to help position the tape in a horizontal plane.
* In some obese subjects, it may be difficult to identify a waist narrowing. In such cases, the smallest horizontal circumference should be measured in the area between the ribs and iliac crest.
* The measurement should be taken at the end of a normal expiration, without the tape compressing the skin. It is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.

### 6.3.3 Wrist Circumference

* The measurer faces the subject who stands and flexes the arm at the elbow so that the palm is uppermost and the hand muscles relaxed.
* A tape is placed just distal to the styloid processes of the radius and ulna, which are located by palpating with the index or middle finger of each hand.
* The tape is positioned perpendicular to the long axis of the forearm and in the same plane on the anterior and posterior aspects of the wrist.
* The tape must be no more than 0.7 cm wide.
* The measurement is made with the tape touching the skin around the whole circumference but not compressing the soft tissue.
* The wrist circumference is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.

### 6.3.4 Mid-Upper Arm Circumference

* For this measurement the subject stands erect. With arms hanging freely at the sides of the trunk and with the palms facing the thighs.
* The subject wears loose clothing without sleeves to allow total exposure of the shoulder area.
* If the midpoint of the upper arm has been marked for the measurement of triceps or biceps skinfolds, this should be used as the level for the measurement of arm circumference.

1. To locate the midpoint, the subject’s elbow is flexed to a 90° angle with the palm facing superiorly. The measurer stands behind the subject and locates the lateral tip of the acromion by palpating laterally along the superior surface of the spinous process of the scapula.
2. A small mark is made at the identified point.
3. The most distal point on the acromial process is located and marked.
4. A tape is placed so that it passes over these two marks, and the midpoint between them is marked.
5. With the arm relaxed and the elbow extended and hanging, just away from the side of the trunk and the palm facing the thigh, place the tape around the arm so that it is touching the skin, but not compressing the soft tissue.
6. The tape is positioned perpendicular to the long axis of the arm at the marked midpoint, and the circumference is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.

### 6.3.5 Calf Circumference

* The subject should wear little clothing so that the tape may be positioned correctly. The measurement should not be made over clothing. Suggest the subject wear shorts or wear a gown.

1. The subject should sit in a chair with knees and hips flexed to a 90° angle.
2. The measurer bends down on the right side and has the subject raise their heel to flex the calf muscle (subject will be resting on the front ball of the foot, heal will be raised).
3. Using a non-stretching tape measure at the widest point on the calf.
4. Take measurement twice and record.

### 6.3.6 Height

Height is measured to the nearest mm. With the subject in stocking feet, using a wall mounted Holtain Limited stadiometer. There is a 600mm calibration bar attached to the stadiometer for yearly calibration.

### 6.3.7 Weight

Weight is measured to the nearest .1 kg. Using a digital Healthometer digital scale. The scale is calibrated once a year.

### 6.3.8 Neck Size

Neck size is determined with a non-stretchable cloth measuring tape to the nearest 0.5 cm while the subject is seated with the head in the Frankfort horizontal plane, measuring at the point below the thyroid prominence, keeping the tape perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the neck.
