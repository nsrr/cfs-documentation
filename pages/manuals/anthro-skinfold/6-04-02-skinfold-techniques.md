## 6.4.2 Skinfold Techniques

The following techniques are taken from the Applied Body Composition Assessment.

1. Take all skinfold (SKF) measurements on the right side of the body.
2. Carefully identify, measure, and mark the SKF site, especially if you are a novice.
3. Grasp the SKF firmly between the thumb and index finger of your left hand.  The fold is lifted 1 cm above the site to be measured.
4. Lift the fold by placing the thumb and index finger 8cm (~3in) apart on a line that is perpendicular to the long axis of the skinfold.  The long axis is parallel to the natural cleavage lines of the skin.  However, for individuals with extremely large skinfolds, the thumb and finger will need to be separated more than 8 cm in order to lift the fold.
5. Keep the fold elevated while the measurement is taken.
6. Place the jaws of the caliper perpendicular to the fold, approximately 1cm below the thumb and index finger, and release the jaw pressure slowly.
7. Take the SKF measurement 4 seconds after the pressure is released.
8. Open the jaws of the caliper to remove it from the site.  Close the jaws slowly to prevent damage or loss of calibration.

* When making measurements using calipers, mark the site with a surgical marking pen, and then read the dial of the calipers to the nearest .5 mm.
* A minimum of two measurements must be taken at each site, and if the values differ by more than 10%, additional values must be taken.
* Take skinfold measurements in a rotational order (circuits) rather than consecutive readings at each site.
* Measurements should be taken when the subject’s skin is dry and lotion-free, and they should not be taken immediately following exercise.

Once all the measures are complete on the data sheet, make a copy for Karen Worman and return the original data sheet to the participant’s file. Karen Worman will input the information and give this data to our office for analysis.
