## 3.3 Safety Issues and Precautions for Handling Blood Specimen

In accordance with the OSHA regulations on blood borne pathogens (see appendix for complete OSHA regulations), the LCBR recommends the following laboratory safety protocol for the blood collection at the GCRC:

* Use of non-permeable lab coats, latex gloves, and face shields when handling any blood in any situation where splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of blood may be generated, and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated.
* Use of aerosol containers in all centrifuges is recommended.
* Follow 'Universal Precautions' when handling any blood or urine products.
* Contaminated needles and sharps shall be immediately placed in a puncture-resistant, leak proof container.  Never recap or break needles.
* The Hepatitis B vaccine is offered to all unvaccinated technicians handling blood, and documentation of vaccination, or technician’s declining to be vaccinated, should be kept on file at the GCRC.
