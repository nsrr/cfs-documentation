## 13.14 Equipment Maintenance

### 13.14.1 Wave Tube

The pharyngometer wave tube should be cleaned after every participant use.

1. Using the set of brushes located in the cabinet in room 412 in the GCRC, start with the brush with the red band at the handle.
2. Use the labeled spray bottle of diluted bleach solution to spray the brush (2-3 sprays).  This solution will be mixed daily, discarding the unused portion every day.
3. Insert the brush into the pharyngometer tube, brushing the inside several times.
4. Invert the tube onto the stand provided.
5. Allow the tube to sit for at least 10 minutes.
6. Using the brush with the blue band around the handle, spray the brush with clean water (2-3 sprays).
7. Insert the brush into the tube scrubbing the inside several times.
8. Invert the tube onto the stand once again and let sit for 10 minutes or until dry on the inside.
9. Use the brush with no color at the handle. This brush should be dry, scrub the inside of the tube with the dry brush several times.
10. Wipe the outside of the wave tube with rubbing alcohol. The tube is now ready for another participant.

### 13.14.2 Mouth Pieces

Mouth pieces will be cleaned after every use.

1. Using soap and water, clean every mouth piece to remove any obvious dirt.
2. Mix a solution of bleach and water in the container provided. The ratio of bleach to water is 1:50.
3. After the pieces have been soaking for at least 20 minutes, rinse the pieces with tap water.
4. Using the spray bottle labeled rubbing alcohol, spray the pieces (this will be a diluted to 1:2, alcohol to water). An alternative would be to rinse the pieces with sterile water after they have been disinfected.
