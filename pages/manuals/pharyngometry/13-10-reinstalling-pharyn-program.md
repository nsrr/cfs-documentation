## 13.10 Reinstalling the Pharyngometry Program

In the event that power is disrupted during the time the pharyngometry program is running, or any other serious flaws exist which cannot be eliminated by simply powering down and rebooting the computer, the pharyngometry program should be reinstalled.

1. From the Window’s Main Screen, double click the **Short Cut to MSDOS** icon.  You will now be at a C:\ prompt.
2. Insert the floppy disk containing the Pharyngometry program into drive A:\.
3. Type **“A:\”** to reach the A prompt.
4. Type **“reinstall”** and allow the computer to update the program files.  You may need to reboot the computer before it can officially update the program.
5. Re-run the program to see if reinstallation was successful.
