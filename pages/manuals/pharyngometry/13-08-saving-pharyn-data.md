## 13.8 Saving Pharyngometry Data Files

After acquiring one ‘nose breath’ trial and three reproducible ‘mouth breath’ trials, you are ready to save the subject’s file and exit the pharyngometry program.

1. Using the left/right arrow keys, highlight **Save** at the bottom of the screen.
2. Press **Enter**.
3. On the bottom of the screen, there will be a prompt, **“Do you wish to review patient data?  Y/N”** Select **Y**.  This will bring up the patient information screen that you used earlier to enter subject specific information.
4. Make sure that all the information listed is correct. Use the up/down arrow keys to move any prompt for information that you may want to change.
5. Press **Esc** to exit this screen and return to the Main Acquisition screen.
6. The prompt will say, **“save file: filename: [space]”**.  Type **"f"** and the participant’s four-digit ID (ex: f1111).
7. Press **Enter**.  They screen will quickly flash blank and return to the same screen with no further prompts given.
8. You can assume that the file was saved.

**<u>NOTE</u>:** Once saved, the subject information and data cannot be manipulated and re-saved under the same name.  Make sure data are accurate and complete before saving.
