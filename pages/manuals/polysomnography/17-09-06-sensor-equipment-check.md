## 17.9.6 Final Sensor Equipment Check

Now that you have ascertained that all sensors have been properly applied, you will need to check that everything is secured (both to guarantee that leads won’t be lost during the night as well as to maximize the participant’s comfort and mobility).

1. Make sure that all lead wires on the face and scalp point down and back towards the back of the neck. Wires from the face and scalp should be pulled away from the face and draped to back of subject's head with enough lag to prevent them from being pulled out, but not so much as to restrict head movement. (Check by having subject move head back and forth and ascertaining that sufficient freedom of movement exists).
2. Secure wires at the shoulder.
3. Re-check oximtery signal (see appropriate section) to verify that the probe still giving the same reading as during initial hook-up.
4. Check that the respiratory bands and thermistor are still secure and in place.
