## 17.3 Prior to the Visit

### 17.3.1 Participant Preparation

One to two days prior to the visit, call the participant to confirm. Ask about usual bedtime. Request the participant:

* To shower or bathe less than 24 hours of their arrival.
* To shampoo and refrain from using hairsprays, gels, mousse, and/or oils in the hair.
* Men should be asked to shave before the visit.
* To be dressed in a t-shirt, tank top, or 2-piece bed clothes.  Encourage the participant to avoid wearing a long nightgown, nightshirt or one-piece garment that would need to be lifted above the waist.

_Explain that this is not an issue of cleanliness, but that the special procedures require the skin to be as free from oils as possible._
