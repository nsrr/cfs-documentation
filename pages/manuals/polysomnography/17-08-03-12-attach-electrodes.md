## 17.8.3.12 Attach Gold Disk Electrodes

The gold disk electrodes are applied to the prepared sites with an electrolyte paste.  This paste serves a dual purpose: providing both a conductive pathway for the signal to enter the electrode cup, as well as holding the electrode in place on the skin.  There are different electrolyte pastes available, as well as different application techniques.

Although different pastes may be used for different electrodes sites (EEG, EOG or EMG sites) both SHHS and manufacturers recommend never mixing pastes for the same electrode. _Adverse reactions to mixing 2 electrolytes together cannot be predicted._

* 1. Assemble your supplies in advance.  Have several pieces of cut gauze or pieces of tape ready to place on top of the electrode once it is placed on the skin.  Gravity can move the electrode from its proper site while you fumble with equipment.
* 2. Prior to attaching gold disk electrodes, cut a sufficient length (approximately 2 arm’s length) of Surgitube 1” tube gauze.
* 3. Run the gold disk electrodes through the length of the tube gauze to create a cotton sheath encasing all of the wires.
* 4. Secure the Surgitube sheath with a twisty or another appropriate fastener approximately 12-18” from the gold disks.  This will allow for the electrodes to be placed according to the color codes and for range of motion at the neck, yet will still provide for bundling of the 10 electrode wires.
* 5. Place a small amount of EC2 electrolyte paste onto a clean disposable surface (i.e.: 4x4 gauze square, small plastic med. cup, or the back of your gloved non-dominant hand).

 * If working in a hairy area, separate the hair in order to see the skin.  Your site should still be visible from the prep phase.
 * If the participant is expected to sweat, there are additional skin preparations that reduce the moisture of the skin (such as PRE-TAC) and help improve the holding power of the adhesive. Try experimenting with such preparations.
 * Generally, these liquids are applied very sparingly to prepped skin and allowed to dry before continuing with electrode application.
 * If using tape, ask the participant about sensitivity to tape, latex or adhesives.  For participants with sensitivity use Micropore (paper) tape.
 * If using EC2 cream on the gauze square to anchor the electrode, it must also be the electrolyte used within the electrode cup.

* 6.  When applying disk electrodes, work in a fashion so that the wires on the forehead and top of the head all point to the back of the head and down toward the neck, and the wires on the face and chin point upwards over the ears and then down toward the back of the neck.  Use small pieces of tape to hold the wires in place as they course toward the back of the head, but allow enough slack so there is no pull when the participant moves.
* 7.  Discard the unused electrolyte paste when finished.  Never contaminate your original tube or bottle.
