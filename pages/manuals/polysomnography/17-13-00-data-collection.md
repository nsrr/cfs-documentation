## 17.13 Data Collection

Offlines (automatic analysis) are run on all studies over at the GCRC before saving to a CD disc and brought back to the scoring office to be scored.  CD discs with the studies for scoring are placed in the folders with the accompanying papers.  Only studies, which passed initial screening, are scored.

Studies for scoring have to be downloaded from the CD disk to the drive C of scorer computer and scored from the hard drive
