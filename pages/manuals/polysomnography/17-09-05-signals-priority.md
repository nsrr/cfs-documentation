## 17.9.5 Priority of Signals

In order of importance:

1. <u>Oximetry</u> is needed to determine blood oxygen levels during the night. Use the Pulse Wave Form (PWF) signal to help determine if the placement of the sensor is correct.
2. <u>Respiratory channels:</u> chest belt, abdominal belt, thermistor, and nasal cannula. The belts should be around the source of most movement. The chest belt is around the nipple line. The abdominal belt is around the umbilicus and under the ribcage. The thermistor sensors (three wires that protrude from the sensor) should be in the flow of air, but not inside the nose or mouth. The nasal cannula should be inside the nose and underneath the thermistor sensor.
3. <u>Chin electrodes are needed to determine REM stage sleep during the night.</u>
4. <u>At least one **EEG** sensor (C3 or C4) and either A1 or A2</u> should be a good valid signal. Impedances should remain under 10K.
5. <u>EKG electrodes</u>, snore microphone, position sensor, and leg sensors ideally should remain valid all night. If problems occur, please call Heather.  Write a note on the problem flow sheet.
6. With <u>new gold disk leg electrodes</u>, please keep impedances under 30K. It is more important that the impedance values are balanced for each leg then it is to be under 30K.  Impedance values between legs should be within about 5K of each other.  Being too close together can artificially inflate the impedance valueâ€”make sure that the sensors are at least 1 inch apart.
