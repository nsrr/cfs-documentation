## 17.8.3.11 Prepare the Electrode Sites

Before the attachment of gold disk electrodes the skin at the marked sites must be properly cleansed and lightly abraded.  This insures low impedance values.  Excessive impedance defeats the passage of signals into the electrode and, in turn, to the recorder.  For optimal recording the impedance readings of the electrodes should be < 10 kΩ and should be balanced (values should be approximately the same).  One exception is ECG, which can tolerate impedance values up to 30 kΩ.

* Successful skin preparation prior to electrode placement helps to reduce the level of impedance thereby improving the quality of signal.
* Skin preparation requires abrasion to the top layer of the participant’s skin at the electrode site.  Although blood is not evident, the field technician must understand that these areas are now non-intact skin and pose a risk for blood borne pathogens.  SHHS recommends wearing latex or non-latex gloves as personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times when working with non-intact skin and equipment which has been in direct contact with non-intact skin (i.e. used electrodes).
* Use an abrasive preparation.  Preparations such as Nu-Prep and Skin Pure contain relatively less pumice and may be preferred for participants with sensitive or fragile skin.  Preparations with higher pumice concentration (such as Lemon Prep) may be useful for participants with tough or oily skin (and for bald participants).
* Abrade only the area at the marked site.  Gold disk electrodes have a diameter of 1 centimeter, therefore the abrasion should be limited to an area the size of or just slightly larger than the electrode.  On marked sites, remember that the electrode should be placed where the 2 lines intersect.
* The participant should know what to expect!  Please communicate.  You may choose to use the following script: _“Before I attach the electrodes, I have to get your skin ready.  I will be using a special cleaner that sets the skin up for a good contact.  You may feel a little bit of scratching on your skin, it may feel a little like sandpaper, but it should not hurt, and it will not harm your skin.”_

1. Place a small amount of skin prep abrasive onto a clean disposable surface (i.e.: 4x4 gauze square or small plastic med. cup). If working in a hairy area, separate the hair in order to see the skin.  You may find a comb or hairclips useful to create a part and hold the hair back.
2. Use a cotton tipped applicator to transfer a small amount of skin prep directly onto the electrode site.
3. Before lifting the applicator, apply a moderate pressure and make small circular motions repeatedly on the skin.  Take care that you include the center of the site, not just make circles around it leaving the center un-prepped. You may prefer to use a combination of back and forth strokes along with some circular motions.
4. Continuing with moderate pressure, slowly count to 5 while you scrub the site (1 one-thousand, 2 one-thousand, 3 one-thousand, 4 one-thousand, 5 one-thousand).  You are done when the skin    “pinks up”.  Expect some participants to have more fragile skin than others; keep an eye on what you do.  You may have to adjust the pressure or the count time.
5. Prep abrasives are not designed as conductors; remove any excessive prep abrasive from the skin prior to electrode placement.
6. Repeat the above steps for each electrode site.  It is much easier to prep 2 or 3 sites, and then to apply those electrodes, provided you do not lose your prepped sites.
7. Discard the applicator and prep abrasive when finished.  Never contaminate your original tube or bottle.
