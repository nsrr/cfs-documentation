# Dataset introduction

The [CFS dataset](:files_path:/datasets) posted on the NSRR has gone through various post-processing steps in order to prepare the data for more widespread sharing. The source data are from the Cleveland Family Study Coordinating Center. Changes and updates to the source data and have been coordinated in the [cfs-data-dictionary repository](https://github.com/nsrr/cfs-data-dictionary).

## Structure of the Datasets

The Visit 5 dataset contains 735 rows. Datasets from prior visits will contain additional rows for subjects that did not participate in Visit 5.

## Data collection forms

The NSRR provides [original data collection forms as PDFs](:files_path:/forms). Many [variables link to these forms](:datasets_path:/cfs/variables) to give users a better idea about the origins of the underlying data.

The forms are included here for historical purposes only and are not intended for use in prospective studies. If you wish to use these forms, please check existing copyrights and regulations beforehand.
