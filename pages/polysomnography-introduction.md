# Polysomnography introduction

Overnight, in-lab 14-channel polysomnography was performed using the Compumedics E-Series System (Abbotsford, Australia). Briefly, 14-channel polysomnography included monitoring the electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, electromyogram, oronasal flow by thermocouples and nasal pressure, thoracic and abdominal movement by inductance plethysmography, and oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry. In addition to connection of sensors and electrodes, trained staff members completed signal calibrations and checked impedance.  Nocturnal recordings were transmitted to the centralized reading center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and data were scored by trained technicians using current guidelines.

## Signal and annotation files

[Raw polysomnography data](:files_path:/polysomnography) are available for 735 Cleveland Family Study participants. Each recording has a signal file (.EDF) and two versions of the event scoring and epoch staging annotations (.XML).

1. **[EDF](:files_path:/polysomnography/edfs)** - Signal files in the [European Data Format](http://www.edfplus.info/) exported from Compumedics Profusion.
2. **[XML (Profusion)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-profusion)** - Annotation files exported from Compumedics Profusion. ([Learn more...](https://github.com/nsrr/edf-editor-translator/wiki/Compumedics-Annotation-Format))
3. **[XML (NSRR)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-nsrr)** - Annotation files processed in the [EDF Editor and Translator](https://www.sleepdata.org/community/tools/12) tool.
